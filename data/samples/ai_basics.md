# Artificial Intelligence Basics

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

## Types of AI

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks within a limited domain. Examples include:
- Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa
- Image recognition systems
- Recommendation engines
- Spam filters

### General AI (Strong AI)
General AI refers to systems that possess human-level intelligence across all domains. This type of AI can understand, learn, and apply knowledge in any intellectual task that a human can do.

### Superintelligent AI
Superintelligent AI would surpass human intelligence in all areas, including creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.

## Key Components of AI

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn patterns.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been particularly successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

### Computer Vision
Computer vision is a field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images.

## Applications of AI

### Healthcare
- Medical diagnosis and treatment planning
- Drug discovery and development
- Personalized medicine
